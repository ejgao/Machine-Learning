All Machine Learning datasets are taken from Kaggle. 
First step, I used different machine models, and all the features provided in the dataset in order to make predictions and evaluate the accuracy of the models.
I used PCA and other feature tuning methods from Scikit Learn, and then evaluated accuracy of models.
